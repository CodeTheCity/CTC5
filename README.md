# CTC5
Parent repo for the projects of Code The City 5 which took place 24th - 25th October 2015

This event was perhaps the best written-up of the weekends. 

For now you can search for these [here](http://codethecity.org/2015/10/) but I will try to provide better links. 

The projects were:

* [Jazz Birhdays](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/jazz_birthdays) a perpetually unfinished project by [Ian](https://github.com/watty62)
* [Data Musicians](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/data-musicians)
* [Landlords](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/landlords)
* [Landlord Code](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/landlord-code) - appears to be empty
* [Find-It](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/find-it) - also appears to be empty
